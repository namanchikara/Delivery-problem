# Delivery-problem

We have latitude and longitude points of N societies, order count of these societies, I also have latitude and longitude points of a warehouse from where the trucks will deploy and will be sent to these various societies(like Amazon deliveries). A truck can deliver maximum 350 orders (order count < 350). Now we determine a pattern in which the trucks should be deployed in such a way that a minimum number of trips occur.

There are no restrictions on the number of trucks, data will pe provided in sample_d.csv file

Solved it in python using heuristic algorithm ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem )
